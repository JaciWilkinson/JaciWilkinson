I'm currently a Staff Designer at Ad Hoc on the Product Forms team (as of May 2024). I've previously worked as a UX researcher and design lead on programs within the Library of Congress and the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. The first eight years of my career, I was an academic librarian specializing in library user experiences, library website management, and library discovery systems.
